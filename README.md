Anyone who maintains a mountain of files (images, videos, audio or textfiles) knows what it feels like: when confronted with thousands of vacation photos, the thought of having to go through all of them is dreadful - no man possess such computing power, no man can spare thought to each of them. It is almost better to simply leave them be, rather than dare go through them.

But consider Youtube's video recommendation algorithm. Out of millions of videos, it knows exactly which ones to present to you. Never knowing which choices have never been shown, 'information overload' doesn't happen.

What if you had such a program on your computer, which lets you browse through your mountain of files; vacation photos and pirated music, just like videos on youtube?

# Sample Feed
Download ''Sample Feed.zip'' and open feedtest.feed for a quick Demo of the program.

# How to use
Open a .feed file or a folder (recursively, if you want).

To create a .feed file (a normal UTF-8 text file), click the button. You can add folders, tags and allowed extensions to your .feed, and then assign tags to each folder.

"Successor mod": Search for a file within the same folder, whose title number is 1 greater than the current. Eg 02 from 01.
